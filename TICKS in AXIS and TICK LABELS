# CREATE YOUR OWN TICKS:

x <- seq(-2.5,2.5,0.01)
y <- dnorm(x)
plot(x,y, type='l', lwd = 3, col = "gray50", xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = seq(-2.5,2.5,0.5))

# SELECTING SIZE OF THE TICKS:

Use the option tck = -.01, for example, as in:

qqnorm(sample, pch=19, cex.main = .9, cex.lab = .5, cex.axis =.4, tck = -.01, col='orange')


# SELECTING THE SIZE OF THE TICK LABELS (THE NUMBERS IN THE x AND y AXIS):

The option is cex.axis = .4, for example

# SELECTING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TICKS AND THE TICK LABELS:

Its the second option in the so-called mpg par option (in the example below, 0.2):

par(mgp=c(1,0.2,0))
qqnorm(sample, pch=19, cex.main = .9, cex.lab = .5, cex.axis =.4, tck = -.01, col='orange')

# SELECTING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TICKS AND ITS LABELS TO THE AXIS LABELS:

This is the first option in the mpg par option (in the example, 1):

par(mgp=c(1,0.2,0))
qqnorm(sample, pch=19, cex.main = .9, cex.lab = .5, cex.axis =.4, tck = -.01, col='orange')


The `first` value in `mgp` is where your `axis labels` moves either close to or far from axis, less value means closer to axis and 
high value means far from axis on both the axis i.e. x and y axis.

The `second` value in `mgp` is where your `tick labels` moves either close to or far from ticks, less value means closer to tick and 
high value means far from ticks on both the axis i.e. x and y axis.

The `third` value in `mgp` is where your `ticks` moves either close to or far from axis line itself, less value means closer to axis line 
and high value means far from axis line on both the axis, i.e. x and y. 

`mar` is a numerical vector of the form `c(bottom, left, top, right)` which gives the number of lines of margin to be specified on the four sides of the plot. 
The default is `c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1`.
