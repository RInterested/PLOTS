cex = .5       SIZE OF THE POINTS IN THE PLOT
cex.main = .9  SIZE OF THE TITLE OF THE PLOT
cex.lab = .5   FONT SIZE FOR THE AXIS LABELS (NAMES X AND Y AXES).
cex.axis =.4   FONT SIZE FOR THE TICK LABELS (NUMBERS IN X AND Y AXES).
tck = -.01     SIZE OF THE ACTUAL TICK MARKS

Related, the actual relative position of the labels and ticks can be specified before calling the plot with:

par(mgp=c(1,0.2,0))

The first value is where your axis labels moves either close to or far from axis, 
less value means closer to axis and high value means far from axis on both the axis i.e. x and y axis.

The second value is where your tick labels moves either close to or far from ticks, 
less value means closer to tick and high value means far from ticks on both the axis i.e. x and y axis.

The third value is where your ticks moves either close to or far from axis line itself, 
less value means closer to axis line and high value means far from axis line on both the axis, i.e. x and y.

The margins of the image can be changed with

mar is a numerical vector of the form c(bottom, left, top, right) which gives the number of lines of margin to be specified on the four sides of the plot. 
The default is c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1.
