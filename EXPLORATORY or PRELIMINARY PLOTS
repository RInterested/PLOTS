### From Statistics - An Introduction using R by R. Crowley

# First plot individual variables to see outliers:

# Continuous variables:

plot(y) # If there is an outlier, say greater than 10, use 

which(y>10) 
[1] 50

# Check out the specific value:

y[50]
[1] 0.8274156

# If it is incorrect, correct it:

y[50] <- 0.9

# For factor variables use table - and check for additional factor levels:

table(nitrogen) # we have the data set attached.

# If there is a mispelling:

which(nitrogen=="perhaps")

  # RELATIONSHIPS:

# For continuous data:

plot(x, y,pch=21,bg="red")

# If explanatory variable is categorical:

plot(factor(month), temperature)

  # INTERACTIONS:
  
  # Interactions between continuous explanatory variables:
  
coplot(yâˆ¼x|z,pch=16,panel=panel.smooth)

  # Interaction between categorical variables:
  
  tapply(yield,list(nitrogen,phosphorus),mean)
  
  barplot(tapply(yield,list(nitrogen,phosphorus),mean),beside=TRUE,xlab="phosphorus")
  legend(locator(1),legend=c("no","yes"),title="nitrogen",fill=c("black","lightgrey"))
