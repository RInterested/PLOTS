# UNLESS THE hist() call includes prob = T THIS WILL NOT WORK WELL!

# Copy and paste for an example:

x1 = 5
x0 = 0.1  # It can't be zero; otherwise X^0^(neg) is 1/0.
n = -2.5  # It has to be negative.
y = runif(1e5)
x = ((x1^(n+1) - x0^(n+1))*y + x0^(n+1))^(1/(n+1))
hist(x, prob = T, breaks=40, ylim=c(0,10), xlim=c(0,1.2), border=F, col="yellowgreen", main="Power law density")
lines(density(x), col="chocolate", lwd=1)
lines(density(x, adjust=2), lty="dotted", col="darkblue", lwd=2)
